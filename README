- recommenders/ contains all recommenders
- all recommenders are derived from generic recommender
- evaluation_stats are the functions to evaluate the results and are stored in the results file
- mpc = mpseq

- in main.py, rankers = [..] have to contain a set of generic recommenders that will be evaluated on the data
- BASEDIR should contain directories with all directories with the output from the dataprocessing.py script
- cycle time is optional for a couple of algorithms
- mpc is mpseq in the paper

- Fill in the rankers in main.py and run the algorithm
- Run the script and evaluate the results in fancy_graphs.ipynb
