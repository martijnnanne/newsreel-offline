CODE MASTER THESIS MARTIJN NANNE: AN OFFLINE ANALYSIS OF THE CLEF-NEWSREEL EVALUATION


- recommenders/ contains all recommenders
- all recommenders are derived from generic recommender
- in order to make new recommender systems I suggest to extend generic recommender and implement the necessary methods
- evaluation_stats are the functions to evaluate the results and are stored in the results file
- mpc = mpseq in the thesis
- statistics notebook has been used to determine general statistics about the data (shown in our data analysis section in the thesis)

- in main.py, rankers = [..] have to contain a set of generic recommenders that will be evaluated on the data
- mpc is mpseq in the thesis

** To preprocess the data, see the README file in the dataprocessing directory **

** To run main.py after you have done your dataprocessing **
- BASEDIR should contain directories with all directories with the output from the dataprocessing.py script
- Fill in the rankers = [...] in main.py and run the algorithm
- Run main.py and evaluate the results in fancy_graphs.ipynb
